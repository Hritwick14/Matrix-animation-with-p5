# Matrix-animation-with-p5
I made this project after watching the movie "The Matrix". I saw that there were a lot of projects intended on creating this same animation from the movie, but none of them were accurate. I tried to make the animation as similar as possible by fine tuning it and all. Use it as you wish.
And also I made this with p5.js, as i am a fan of Daniel Shiffman from the YouTube channel "The Coding Train". Cheers!!
